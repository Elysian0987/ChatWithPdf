Solution: Reactivate Your Virtual Environment
Go to your project folder if you're not already there:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd C:\Users\samru\Documents\GitHub\ChatWithPdf\askmypdf
Run this to activate your venv:

bash
Copy
Edit
venv\Scripts\activate
You’ll know it's active when you see (venv) in the terminal — like before.

Now try running Streamlit again:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py

pip install sentence-transformers
